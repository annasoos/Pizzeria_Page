# Pizzeria Restaurant

## Description

Webpage created (as a team project) to a fictional pizzeria, to browse the menu and book a table to the restaurant.

## Implementation


1. The landing page will not just introduce the user in the web site, but show the menu also. The page is responsive.
    - When we get to the web site, an image with the name of the pizzeria welcomes us
    - When we scroll down a short introduction present the business
    - Under the introduction, we can see the menu's options, the topping and the price

2. In the landing page there is a possibility to booking a table. The form is presented in a different page. The user needs to fill up a form with its name, email address, booking date and time and the number of seats the user want to book.
    - There is a `Booking a table` button in the bottom of the page and in the navigation bar as well.
    - When we click the button a booking form shows up
    - All inputs are required
    - We can't book a table before the actual date
    - We can't book a table one hour before the actual time

## TODO

- Fix navigation from Booking page to About and Menu sections
- Use react modal package in case of booking form
- Set fire icons to show only on spicy pizzas
- Use more elegant message display (eg. ract tostify)
